# Rails Wars

University of Paris project that can connect to French rail transport's API to retrieve different kind of data.

## Getting Started

First you'll need to install version 10.2 (or higher) of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) . If you're on Linux / Mac os, you can install it using your Package Manager. Make sure you have NPM up and running on your machine. When Node and Npm are installed, clone this repository by typing the following command :

  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:arthosd/RailsWar.git
  ```

### Installing dependencies

Go to the project's root and run the following command to install node modules.

```bash
  npm install --save
  ```
 If node and npm was installed properly no errors should occur.
 
 ### Running the project
 
 In the root project run the following command :
 
 ```bash
  npm run start
  ```
 
 Nodemon should launch automatically. You can now type http://localhost:8080/ in your web browser url bar. If "Hello World" appears on your screen, you're good to go.
